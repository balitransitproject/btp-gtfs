# Bali Transit Project - GTFS

A repository of General Transit Feeds Specification [GTFS](https://github.com/google/transit/tree/master/gtfs/spec/en) files for Bali transit systems.

Generated using [easy-timetable-generator](https://github.com/mapanica/easy-timetable-generator) and [osm2gtfs](https://github.com/grote/osm2gtfs) following official schedule information. Verified using [transitfeed](https://github.com/google/transitfeed) prior to upload.

All transit routes and stops to be mapped in [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org) prior to generation of GTFS files.
